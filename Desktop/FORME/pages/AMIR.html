        <h1>To my little brother Amir,</h1>
        <p>You got so much life ahead of you, and I'm so excited to see you grow into something special. You got so much to give, and I see so much in you.</p>
        <p>My dream for you as a young man growing in this new digital age is to let yourself define what you want—not let social media or people's opinions change your path. You are so powerful, just as you were when you came into this world. Grow and change, but not for the sake of another man's whim—do it because you will it.</p>
        <p>I'm here for you in the highs and lows, and they will come, but that's all part of the ride. So just put your arms up and get ready—because this shit goes fast.</p>
        <p>Love you, Goomba Man.</p>
