        <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
        <p>I just wanted to take a moment to thank youâ€”for managing the dog. I know it's not easy. I know how much patience, strength, and love it takes. And yet, you do it every day, without hesitation, without asking for anything in return.</p>
        <p>More than anything, thank you for walking through fire. Even when you can't see the flames, you feel the heat. And still, you keep going. Still, you stand strong.</p>
        <p>I see it. I feel it. And I appreciate it more than I can ever put into words.</p>
        <p>With love,<br>Sekou Roland</p>
