        <h1>Reid,</h1>
        <p>We were both the new kids, chasing the same dream of playing football. Through everything, we grinded together. I still think back to those days on the field—especially during COVID. That time meant everything to me. No matter what, you showed up every day, in sickness and in health, and I'll always respect that.</p>
        <p>I want to apologize for my lack of leadership on our team. Back then, I hadn't found my voice. I'm still finding pieces of it now, but I know I need more because there's so much I want to achieve. None of it will happen if I don't speak up.</p>
        <p>Thank you for grinding with me. That was the realest thing. Nobody has ever put in the work with me, every single day, like that. And that was exceptional. You made me better—I hope I did the same for you.</p>
        <p>– Sekou</p>
