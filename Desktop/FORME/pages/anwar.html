        <p>You have so much potential, and I don't think you fully realize the power you hold as an individual. Your mind is brilliant—it holds thoughts and questions that no one has ever fathomed. You need to reach in, pull those tools from your experience, and use them.</p>
        <p>One thing I've realized, even as I write this, is how uncomfortable it can be to explore the past. Those experiences, the painful ones, they aren't easy to face. But they are what make you strong. Take that power and use it. Examine it. Find the value in the pain, and you will be unstoppable.</p>
        <p>Pain is growth. Pain is a path forward. Don't let it be your downfall—let it be your inspiration to create the world you want to live in.</p>
