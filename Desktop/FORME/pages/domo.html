        <h1>Domo,</h1>
        <p>The joy of a friend—whatever it is, people around you just feel it. You've got a way of putting a smile on faces. Yeah, you might be a lazy piece of shit, but you're a good friend, and that's something I don't take for granted.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of people out there, a lot of friends who fall short, and so do you—but never where it matters. You're always there, always ready. You might be pissy, but you always look out. And I respect that.</p>
        <p>I'm looking forward to doing the same shit we've always done—but with a fuck ton of money. We've already seen some crazy shit, but it's time for us to get a chair and play at the table. I'm sick of being a spectator. I want to get my hands dirty, and I know you'll be right there with me.</p>
        <p>People are drawn to you because of your humanity and strength. You know who you are, and you've never let the world change that. I respect that.</p>
        <p>And I know you're gonna be Domo until the day you get sent back to the lobby.</p>
