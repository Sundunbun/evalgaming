        <h1>Thank you for everything you do.</h1>
        <p>Your perspective on this world has guided me through some of the hardest parts of my journey.</p>
        <p>I walk through this world with no fear as a Black man because you have done it before me. You have equipped me, warned me, and made me stronger so that I can take things head-on. I know it might seem like I'm always doing a lot, always taking on the hardest challengesâ€”but that is what life has presented me since the day I was born.</p>
        <p>"Let them come," you said.</p>
        <p>You told me they would.</p>
        <p>And I am ready.</p>
        <p>- Your Son</p>
