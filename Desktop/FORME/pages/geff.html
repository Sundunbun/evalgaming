        <h1>Geff,</h1>
        <p>I love the way you work, kid. Fuck an excuse. You might say one, but it never holds power over you. You've shown me what it really means to compete—to define a man's worth not by his words, but by his actions.</p>
        <p>You grind, and I respect that. I want that for myself.</p>
        <p>We committed to this, and sometimes I forget where all this football shit started. You definitely conned my ass into coming to Deerfield, but thank God I did. You and all the boys have been pillars of support and joy since day one—even though y'all have lame-ass, unintelligent pranks.</p>
        <p>Btw, I'm going to the NFL. Hope to see you there.</p>
        <p>– Sekou</p>
