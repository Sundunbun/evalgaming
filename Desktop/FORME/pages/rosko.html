        <h1>Dear Coach Rosko,</h1>
        <p>I just wanted to take a moment to thank you—for seeing something in me when I couldn't see it for myself. Maybe you were lying, maybe you weren't, but either way, I found a piece of that person within me. And that means everything.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I forget that there is more in me—I simply have to seek it. But you are a constant reminder that I am capable of things beyond what I can even fathom.</p>
        <p>Belief is a weapon of power. It can change everything. And I believe, Coach Rosko—thanks to you.</p>
        <p>With gratitude,<br>Sekou Roland</p>
